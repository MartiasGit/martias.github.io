## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used media queries for a responsive look on mobile devices. Styling the QR card to resemble the assignment as much as possible.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (max-width: 376px) {
        .container {
          ...
        }
```

### Continued development

Perfect the mobile-first technique. Improve your sense of website design and layout.
